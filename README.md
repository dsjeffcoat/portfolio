# Personal Tech Portfolio Site - Version 1

This was another version of my portfolio site that I was working on before moving towards a React portfolio site. This was made using strictly HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript. I'm currently considering redoing it for my past writing work and having it as the new site for my Jaysen Dante writing brand.
